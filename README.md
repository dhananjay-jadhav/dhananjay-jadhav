Hi — I’m Dhananjay.

I work on building reliable backend systems and straightforward developer tools. I primarily use Node.js and TypeScript, and I enjoy applying patterns that help teams move faster: microservices, event-driven design, and simple, testable APIs.

What I focus on
- Backend services and APIs (NestJS, Express, GraphQL)
- Event-driven integrations and streaming (Kafka)
- Developer tooling and DX: lightweight tools, Docker workflows, and monorepo templates
- Front-end interfaces where they help surface data clearly (React)

Selected projects
- Lightweight Docker Desktop App — a small desktop utility to manage local containers and inspect logs without the command line.
- Microservice templates & monorepo tooling — starter templates and shared packages to keep services consistent and easy to maintain.
- GraphQL client & federation work — pragmatic solutions for resilient API calls, standardized error handling, and federation-level validation.
